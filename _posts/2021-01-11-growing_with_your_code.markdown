One of coding’s biggest virtues is how ever-changing it is. With coding, there is always more to learn and room for improvement. Languages are always updating and with it so are our programs, which is why I am so passionate about what I do. 

I make sure to base my projects around factors that can be further developed and that are relatable to me. This makes my projects that much more exciting and personal, knowing that in no time I’ll be able to revisit my work and not only improve it but expand it. That way the more I grow, the more my projects grow with me. Given the Software Development Cycle, which I regularly reference, I have a better understanding of the ongoing changes and growth my code is capable of.

A great way to keep track of what additions you may want to add is to make a simple list in a readme file. I personally label my list as “Future Plans” where I name the features I plan on adding to my projects. This works as a reminder that drives me to revisit and better my work constantly. Because as the Greek philosopher, Heraclitus, said: “change is the only constant.”
