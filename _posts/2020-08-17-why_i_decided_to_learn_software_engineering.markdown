Like many of us, I did not know about "coding" or "software" for most of my life. I cannot say software engineering has always been my dream but I can say that it is my true passion, and here is how I found that out.

     I was considered to be "tech savvy" when I was a kid, just because I could work myself through a device’s settings and connect it to the Wi-Fi. Even being told this all my life, I went through much of high school thinking I would go to school to work in the medical field, but I could never imagine myself in that line of work. I found myself searching for career fields that would fit with me and vice-versa. That is where engineering came to mind, even my 10th grade math teacher recommended engineering to me since she always found me looking for efficient short cuts to solve problems. Slowly but surely, I was gaining hope that I would find my true calling. Eventually I narrowed it down to Computer Science and Engineering which included my passion for creating and my dedication to technology.
 
     I started to learn about coding and software and found it to be somewhat overwhelming but had a gut feeling that this is the career meant for me. It has not been easy for me and I would often see others in a more advanced stage from me and would quickly doubt myself. This still happens but that’s why I decided to stick with software engineering. It is challenging and since it is everchanging you can never learn enough, which keeps it interesting and exciting. 

     I ended up moving to Florida as soon as I graduated from high school in Puerto Rico and attended Valencia College. Two years later I obtained my Associates Degree. During this journey I met some of the best and most helpful people, in my coding courses, which is very important for me. I gravitate toward fields that are more of a community than anything else. We are all in the same boat and help each other succeed. 

This is why I decided to study Software Engineering. It is the only career field I see myself in.
