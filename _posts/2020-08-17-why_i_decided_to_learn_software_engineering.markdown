Like many of us, I did not know about "coding" or "software" for most of my life. I cannot say software engineering has always been my dream but I can say that it is my true passion, and here is how I found that out.

I started to learn about coding and software and found it to be somewhat overwhelming but had a gut feeling that this is the career meant for me. It has not been easy for me and I would often see others in a more advanced stage from me and would quickly doubt myself. This still happens but thatâ€™s why I decided to stick with software engineering. It is challenging and since it is everchanging you can never learn enough, which keeps it interesting and exciting. I ended up moving to Florida as soon as I graduated from high school in Puerto Rico and attended Valencia College. Two years later I obtained my Associates Degree. During this journey I met some of the best and most helpful people, in my coding courses, which is very important for me. I gravitate toward fields that are more of a community than anything else. We are all in the same boat and help each other succeed. 
 

This is why I decided to study Software Engineering. It is the only career field I see myself in.
