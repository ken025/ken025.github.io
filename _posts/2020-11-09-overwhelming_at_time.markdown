I am now in module 3 of the Flatiron Bootcamp and to say the least, I am excited to have gotten this far and even more excited about where I will go. To this point, the Bootcamp has definitely been challenging but rewarding. I always find myself stuck in errors that may take me hours to figure out and end up being a simple fix. I question whether I truly know what I’m doing, I question whether I bit off more than I can chew, and I question whether I’m the only one struggling. This just makes everything way harder than it should be and at the end of the day, most of us feel the same way. I have always had this terrible habit of comparing myself to others, which ends up in me secluding myself.

I eventually built up the courage, with the help of my lead, and decided to reach out to others. The first thing I noticed was that I was not alone, in terms of feeling like you might be behind or not to the level of others. Many were also finding to have secluded themselves because of this fear. I finally decided to start working on my Rails project and did so alongside a great fellow student. We worked together to get our third-party authenticator set and after days of many trials and errors, we finally got it to work. That’s when I realized what I was missing by secluding myself. I felt comfortable asking her for a second opinion or just for help whenever I got too overwhelmed and confused. Throughout the entire process it made everything easier and smoother than it would have been by myself. We balanced each other out and made the experience fun and enjoyable. 

Sometimes we get in our heads and forget that we are learning and not expected to know everything. I am my own worst critique and in this Bootcamp, it can be very counterproductive. I am still learning to use my self-criticism to my advantage as fuel to keep going and work harder. But this showed me the power of letting yourself ask for help and understand we all, in a way, feel the same way.
