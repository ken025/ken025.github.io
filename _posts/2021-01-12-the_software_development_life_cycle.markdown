The SDLC, can be interpreted many ways but the this is the one I regularly reference. It consists of 6 crucial steps to optimize your code. Here I will go through each and explain how I tackle them.

### Breaking it Down:

#### Planning:
The first step, if course, is to plan out your project. I personally like to start with a visual board as a mock-up of what I envision my app to look like. I often use google docs hodge-podge features together to map out my vision.

#### Analysis:
During this step, is when I analyze the data that I need to fulfill the project. I build a flow-chart to map out the models, their relationships and validations needed to meet the requirements. 

#### Design: 
When designing, I reference my previously built visual board to implement the necessary styling features to simulate the mock built during the planning feature.

#### Implementation:
This is when I start building and creating the web page using the chart built during analysis. Here is where I use various tools depending on the project I am working on, whether that is languages like Ruby or JavaScript or which IDE I use to build such. 

#### Testing and Integration:
An important step during project builds where I focus on making sure it meets the requirements and is reliable. Here I focus on debugging and improving details. 

#### Maintenance:
This step can differ depending on the project. Usually, I ask for other developers to look over the code and use the application to receive feedback and make improvements where needed. 

This serves as an overall guide of what I follow when building a project, but I may go through these in unique ways with each of them. This helps me maintain a structure when starting a project which is always the most challenging part.
